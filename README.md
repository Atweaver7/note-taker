Description
For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. So I created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

Languages and Tools:
Visual Studio Code

1: HTML5
2: CSS3
3: JavaScript
4: Node.js
5: Git
6: GitHub
