Description
For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. So I created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
Languages and Tools:
Visual Studio Code

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript

Node.js

Git

GitHub

Terminal

npm install, npm install express
Usage
- Application should allow users to create and save notes.
